# Sequentior Variables

Variables make the Sequentials more dynamic because you can assign variables to the properties of sequentials instead of assigning direct values.

Moreover, you can modify property values of sequentials via modifying variables from your scripts.

There are two kind of variables in Sequentior:

* [Local Variables](variables.md) : These are variables local to a [Sequentior Manager](../sequentiormanager/index.md).

* [Global Variables](globalvariables.md) : These are variables that can be defined once and retrieved by all sequentials in the project.
