# UI ANIMATIONS

UI Animation Sequentials are very similar to normal Animation Sequentials but they're designed to work with UI elements. 

!!! info
    Please refer to the [Animation Sequentials](../animationsequentials/index.md) because most of the UI animations are very similar to the corresponding Animation Sequential.

But there are some extra sequentials for UI elements which you can learn from this section.
