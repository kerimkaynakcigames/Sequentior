# Object Returner Sequential

This sequential gets a __target object__ that is used by other sequentials.

You can specify the options for how to find the target object.

!!! important
    Understanding how to get target object is important because almost every sequential works on a target game object and all these sequentials get the target object by using options mentioned in this section.

### Target Object Get Type

* [__Single Object:__](single.md) This will return a single game object. So any sequential that gets a target object will perform the actions on this single game object.
* [__Multiple Objects:__](multiple.md) This will return multiple game objects. So any sequential that gets a target object will perform the actions on each of the game objects returned.
