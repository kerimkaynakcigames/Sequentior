# Post Processing Sequentials

Sequentials in this category let you animate parameters of Post Processing effects for both URP and Built-in Render Pipeline. 

Because Unity handles the post processing effects differently for URP and Built-in RP, there are specific sequentials for each post processing effect in both RP. So you need to use the correct one depending on your project render pipeline.

!!! warning
    To use Post Processing related actions, you need to go to the [Setup](../../setup.md) screen and choose related options. Please see the [Setup documentation](../../setup.md) for more information.
