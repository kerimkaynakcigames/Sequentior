## What is Sequentior?

Sequentior is a Unity asset to create a flow of sequences for performing lots of stuff including animations.

!!! warning
    Sequentior is **not** a visual scripting tool! The logic is very similar to a visual scripting tool but Sequentior is built solely for creating sequences in a visual way.


By using Sequentior, you define a logic flow to perform when something happens without writing any code. For example, you can use a Sequentior to create some visual effects when the player hit by an enemy shot. 

!!! info "Why not use Animation or Timeline instead?"
    Unity Animation and Timeline systems are so powerful but not simple enough to use for most of the situations. And they are not easily extensible as Sequentior. 
    
    Creating animation assets for every animation you need makes it very hard to manage. In Sequentior, you just add a component and add as many sequentials as you need in this component.
    
    Although Timelines are specialized for cutscenes, of course you can do more with them. But again, it's not easily managable and it works only for the objects in scene. And when you want to make Animations or Timelines custom stuff, you need to write lots of code to achieve a simple action that a Sequentior Sequential does easily.

The best part is that there are lots of built-in sequentials that performs most needed actions in a game. But also you can create your custom sequentials too for your own needs.

There are two concepts you need to know to use the Sequentior in your games.
