# Adding Custom Sequentior Snippet to the Search List

As you see in [Playing Sequentior Snippet page](playsequentiorsnippet.md), you can play your custom sequentior snippets by using Play Sequentior Snippet Sequential and then assigning the related prefab to it.

But the more convenient way of adding your custom snippets is selecting them directly from Create Sequential search window in a graph which is available for built-in snippets by default.

So to add your custom sequentior snippets to the search list go to the __SequentiorSnippets\Data__ from Project view and select the __Sequentior Snippets Custom__ asset file and add your custom snippet to the Snippets list in the inspector. 

!!! tip
    Search window searches the sequentials by their names and keywords.

!!! tip
    If you can't find __Sequentior Snippets Custom__ file in this directory, you can create a new one by right clicking on that directory and choose Create-> Sequentior -> Snippet Manager and name it Sequentior Snippets Custom.
