# Sequentior Snippets

Sequentior Snippets are ready to use sequentior prefabs that can be used in another sequentior manager graphs.

Think snippets as sequentials for common operations. 

Although I'm adding some built-in sequentior snippets to the package, you can also create your custom snippets very easily.

For example, if you created an image reveal animation that can be used in several places (Sequentior graphs), then you can define this animation as a sequentior snippet with adjustable inputs.

Please read other sub sections of this page to get the idea of using snippets.
